# Introduction to Data Science - How to Think Like a Data Scientist


This repository contains the complete teaching materials (excluding exams and
answers to assignments) and [website](http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology) for a university style and self-guided course teaching computational data skills to biologists. 

[Helpful information](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/docs/) 
is available regarding the structure and function of the course and website
materials for customized development and delivery of the course.


## Where is everything

Core teaching materials are stored in `exercises/`, `lectures/`, and 
`materials/`.

Class specific materials are stored in the `syllabus`, `schedule` and `assignments/`.

Most of the other folders and files support creating the course website using
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
